'''

In the main area of the program, get two numbers from the user.

Create a function that accepts the two numbers as parameters/arguments.
The function adds the two numbers together and returns the sum.

The program (main area) prints the sum.

# Get two number from the user
user1 = float(input("What is the first number you would like to enter? "))
user2 = float(input("What is the second number you would like to enter? "))

def sum(n1,n2):  # Python lets us override its own function names
    return(n1 + n2)

# Some functions do not receive any arguments/parameters.
# Those functions have empty parentheses.
def fn2():
    pass

# Some functions receive arguments/parameters.
# In most languages, these are in the parentheses, and are
# separated by commas.
def fn3(param1):
    print("This is function 3")
    print("It received an argument with the value", param1)
    # Notice that this function has no "return" command.
    # When a function gets to the end of its code, it automatically
    # goes back to whatever place "called" it, even if there is
    # not a "return" command.

def fn4(x,y,z):
    # Sometimes we want a function to end (return) early.
    # In that case we force the return
    if (x + y) == z:
        return # leave the function -- go back to the calling location
    print ("x + y != z") # this line will not be executed if x + y = z

def fn5(a,b):
    # Some functions perform calculations and return the results of 
    # the calculation
    product = a * b
    return product

def fn6(a,b):
    product = a * b
    print(product)

x = sum(user1,user2)

print(f"Here is the sum of the two numbers you have enter {x:.1f}")

# Ask the user for another number.
user3 = float(input("What is the third number you would like to enter? "))
# Use the sum function to add the new number to the previous sum.
y = sum(x,user3)
# Print the result
print(y)

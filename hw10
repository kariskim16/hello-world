'''

Ask the user for three numbers (integers).

Call a function that multiplies all three numbers together.
The function returns true if the product of the three numbers is even.
Otherwise it returns false.

The program's main area prints out whether the product is even based on the 
return from the function.

#MODIFICATION

Change input process so that it is a loop that will continue to collect
numbers until the user enters 0. The numbers are added to a list, and 
the list is passed to the function. The function performs the same operations.

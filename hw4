#if user gave me word to reverse it then I will rewrite backwards but how?
# last letter to be the first letter
#very nice thinking strats for the enemy team to know what functon or loops to use
# print(word[-1])
# print(word[-2])
# print(word[-3])
# print(word[-4])
# print(word[-5])
#for loop():

#for i in range(1,len(word)):

for i in range(len(word)-1,-1,-1):

print()

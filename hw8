'''
The program asks the person what item of clothing to make, 
how much fabric is needed, the cost per yard for the fabric. 
It also asks what the labor rate is and what the markup should be on the costs. 
Finally, it gives a recommended price for the item.

To stay in business, we need to sell items at a profit: Income > Costs
To be certain that our income is greater than our costs, we need to know our costs.
Two common cost categories are materials and labor.

Material costs = yards of fabric x cost per yard
Labor costs = labor rate ($/hour) x hours needed to make the item
Total cost = material costs + labor costs

FOR NEXT TIME:

1) Create a function to handle the input of the floating values. Similar to a previous exercise.
2) Make it so that the program does not crash if the person enters a "bad" input for a numeric value.
    #make it were it wont crash if they put a letter instead of number
3) Have the program repeat until the person enters "quit" for the clothing item.

BONUS!!!!

Before the loop starts, ask how many different clothing items will be made.
Use the input_integer function from hw1.py to handle the input...

Then use a for loop to loop that many times (but still allow "quit" to be entered to exit the program)

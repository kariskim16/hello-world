words = input("What word would you like to use to disemvowel them? ")
print(words)

for the_vowel in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u", "q"]: #the vowel is larerady attached to str so you can use it as a str variable
    words = words.replace(the_vowel,"")
print("I disemvowel your word...", words) #indented within the loop will show step but not indented will show the finish product

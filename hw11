'''
Your mission, should you choose to accept it...

Get input from the user -- any word or number.
Stop getting input once the user enters an empty string (nothing).
Collect the inputs into a list.
Pass the list to a function.
The function goes through each list item and prints whether it is a string or a number.

    '''
    To easily print or evaluate each element in a list, we can use one of the following:
    
    1) for - range version, gives you an index you can use to access the list

        for i in range(len(my_list)):
            print (my_list[i])

    2) for - each version, gives you each element from the list one at a time, but without an index

        for item in my_list:
            print (item)

    3) for - enumerate (combines the above), gives you both an index and the item

        for i, item in enumerate(my_list):
            print (i, item)

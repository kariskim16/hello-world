*** Number guessing game ***

1) Have the computer generate a secret random number (hint: this will require an import)
2) Using a loop (you choose a while or for loop), ask the user to guess the number.
3) If the guess is wrong, tell the user whether he is too low or too high.
4) If the user is correct, show an appropriate message about how awesome the user is. :)

BONUS!!! Figure out how you can import (hint) the function from hw1.py to help with the user's
input of the number.

'''
#import hw1
from hw1 import input_integer # imports only the specified functions -- can call function directly
import random # imports everything from file -- must use module/library name to call functions
secret = random.randint(1,16)
#print(secret)
count = 0
while True: 
    #number = int(input("What is the secret, magic number?: "))
    number = input_integer("Please enter a number!!")
    count += 1

    if number == secret:
        print("You got it right!")
        print("You have guessed,", count, "times.")
        break
    elif number < secret:
        print("Your guess is too low!")
    else:
        print("Your guess is too high!")

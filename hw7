'''

1) Program will ask for a website address (URL) 
2) Program will ask for a search word
3) If the search word has a length greater than 3...

    Use the **requests** module... (or beautiful soup)
    Load the web site
    Count how many times the word occurs on the web page. 
        (There are several possible ways of doing this step.)
        (Can use REGEX **re** or something else.)

Place the above in a loop.
If the person enters "Q" for the URL, the program quits.
If the person enters a search word shorter than 4 letters, request the word again.

'''
DONE! Ask the user for a number, n.
DONE! Generate a list of random numbers with length n.
DONE! Print out the list of random numbers.
DONE! Loop through the list in your main/root program.
DONE! Send each number from the list to a function called "is_odd"
DONE! In is_odd, print out whether the number is odd.
DONE! is_odd should also return true is the number is odd, and false if it is not.
Keep a count of the total number of True returns and display it at the end 
    (e.g., "There were 11 odd numbers in the list")

SECRET BONUS TO BE UNLOCKED LATER....

1) Make it so that the final count report uses correct grammar.
... "There are 3 odd numbers in the list" or "There is 1 odd number in the list"
'''
# if user_input > 1:
#     print(f"There are {count} odd numbers in the list!")
# else:
#     print(f"There is {count} odd number in the list")

'''
2) Add another function that ALSO counts the number of PRIME numbers.
... Note each prime number like you do for odd numbers.
... also keep track of prime numbers and report the total count at the end as with odd numbers.
